    <h1>Question 1</h1>
    <p>Quality is measured by how successful a product or service is at accomplishing what it was made to do. I bought a high quality lemon squeezer a couple of months ago and I am in love with it. Before, I would squeeze lemons and limes with my hands and get them all sticky but now I can throw it in the squeezer, squeeze the handles and have a perfect seedless liquid. It has been used for countless guacamoles and teas, but shows absolutely no wear and tear. Because of this high quality, I recommend it to everybody I see squeezing a lemon or lime. For my company, quality would be extremely important. Working with electrical utility companies means that quality is at the forefront of importance because utilities care a lot about reliability due to regulations that require customers to not lose power. Due to this, in order for my company to be successful I would have to ensure that utility companies can trust my products and feel safe installing them.</p>
