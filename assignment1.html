    <h1>Question 1</h1>
    <p>Quality is measured by how successful a product or service is at accomplishing what it was made to do. I bought a high quality lemon squeezer a couple of months ago and I am in love with it. Before, I would squeeze lemons and limes with my hands and get them all sticky but now I can throw it in the squeezer, squeeze the handles and have a perfect seedless liquid. It has been used for countless guacamoles and teas, but shows absolutely no wear and tear.</p>
