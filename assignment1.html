    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>By James Pasko, for IE673</p>
    <h1>1.    What is quality? How does your company interpret the term: 'quality'?</h1>
    <p>Quality is measured by how successful a product or service is at accomplishing what it was made to do. I bought a high quality lemon squeezer a couple of months ago and I am in love with it. Before, I would squeeze lemons and limes with my hands and get them all sticky but now I can throw it in the squeezer, squeeze the handles and have a perfect seedless liquid. It has been used for countless guacamoles and teas, but shows absolutely no wear and tear. Because of this high quality, I recommend it to everybody I see squeezing a lemon or lime. For my company, quality would be extremely important. Working with electrical utility companies means that quality is at the forefront of importance because utilities care a lot about reliability due to regulations that require customers to not lose power. Due to this, in order for my company to be successful I would have to ensure that utility companies can trust my products and feel safe installing them.</p>
    <h1>2.    What is TQM? How does your company interpret the term: 'TQM'?</h1>
    <p>Total Quality Management is the belief that all employees must be contributing high quality of work in all of their operations so that the company can thus hold a high quality standard. TQM requires a team effort instead of just individual effort in order to succeed. My company interprets the term Total Quality Management as what will push us past our competitors. By having all employees motivated to produce high quality work, this will ensure that our end product is high quality and better than competitors.  </p>
    <h1>3.    How can we achieve organizational excellence with quality?</h1>
    <p>We can achieve organizational excellence with quality by ensuring that customers believe their money is spent wisely. Utilities do not want to waste money on something that will not hold up their standards. They absolutely will spend more money to ensure that they do not need to worry about an unplanned outage, or the cost of labor to replace the part that broke. By producing quality products, my company will achieve organizational excellence by taking the utility industry by storm and capitalizing on an industry that is currently run by 2-3 major players. After my company produces a high quality product that companies can trust, we will be another major player in the industry that is capitalizing on the indirect costs utilities face when a part fails. </p>
    <h1>4.    What is the Deming cycle? How is your company doing this?</h1>
    <p>The Deming Cycle is the Japanese variation of learning from your mistakes. Specifically, it is a cycle of deciding how to do something, doing it, learning what went wrong or right, and changing your plan to get rid of mistakes.This form of continual improvement is integral for success, whether it be personal or professional. My company is doing this by controlling the quality of products produced. There are scheduled intervals in which pieces of equipment are tested to ensure that they have the desired degree of quality. We are also doing this by talking to employees who are making the connectors and asking for feedback. Do they have any ideas as to how something could go faster? Or maybe an idea as to how to make spending more efficient? The production crew serves an integral part of the product’s life cycle and it is important that everybody within the lifecycle feels important and heard. </p>
    <h1>5.    What are the most common errors when starting quality initiatives?</h1>
    <p>According to the textbook, some of the most common errors when starting quality initiatives are senior management delegation and poor leadership, team mania, the deployment process, a narrow dogmatic approach, and confusion about the differences among education, awareness, inspiration, and skill building. I can definitely understand why these are some of the most common errors when starting quality initiatives because when times are tough people start to panic and try to see what they can do to cut costs. Sadly, cutting quality sometimes goes hand in hand in cutting costs. There are many other ways to cut costs to ensure that your quality does not change, but a lot of people believe that the best way to make a cheaper product is jumping right to the manufacturing stage while ignoring all of the other stages. </p>
    <h1>6.    Explain the cost of poor quality . How is your company doing this? What is a QMS (Quality Management System)? What are the key modules of a QMS and how do they interact with each other? Are engineering managers interested in QMS? What can a good QMS do for your company? Explain WHY?</h1>
    <p>There are plenty of costs associated with poor quality, some hidden and some more traditional. The traditional ones are the waste of bad products through rejects, testing, reworks, inspections, recalls, and the returns that customers give when they feel as if they have been cheated of their money. With this comes other hidden costs like the overtime people have to work to fix mistakes, the mental cost of handling complaints and working for a company that may not be well received by the public, delays, excess of inventory, unused capacity, and plenty other costs that really hinder your business. My company is dodging all of these costs by ensuring the product is high quality and that people who work for my company are proud to work there and would be shocked to hear a complaint from a customer. A quality management system is one that makes decisions in order to ensure the achievement of product quality that is consistent with the company’s goals and principles, and the customer’s satisfaction. The key modules of a quality management system are a quality policy, the quality manual, quality objectives, quality procedures, and forms, records, etc to show proof of activity.</p>
    <h1>7.    What are the quality characteristics of world-class organizations?</h1>
    <p>The quality characteristics of a world-class organization is one that focuses on these topics in order to compete in the global marketplace. Customer service, quality control and assurance, research and development, acquiring new technologies, innovation, team-based approach, best practices, manpower planning, environmentally sound practices, business partnerships and alliances, reengineering of processes, mergers and acquisitions, outsourcing and contracting, reliance on consulting services, and political lobbying. These are all characteristics that are imperative for success on the global marketplace because all of the other big companies are doing it. Customers around the world view these characteristics as standards so it is important for any company hoping to be a world-class organization to focus on these characteristics. </p>
    <h1>8.    Responsibility and total quality . How is your company doing this?</h1>
    <p>My company is doing this by not overworking our employees and listening to what they have to say. For employees to continue to pump out valuable work, they must feel as if they are being respected and valued highly. At my company, we make sure that every employee knows that they are part of the team that produces these connectors for the electrical utilities and that they serve a purpose no matter what part of the company they are in. Employees get incentive bonuses to ensure that they understand that the company’s success is their success. Higher quality work deserves to be rewarded and at my company I make sure that everybody is working towards success instead of just completing their job and getting their paycheck. In turn, this will maintain the company principle of total quality and ensure that each employee is responsible in their job and producing work that they are proud of.</p>
    <h1>9.    Discuss some models for ethical quality decisions .How is your company doing this?</h1>
    <p>Some models are the categorical imperative, full-disclosure, doctrine of the mean, golden rule, market-ethic, organizational ethic, equal freedom, proportionality ethic, and professional ethic model. My company believes in the categorical imperative model because we do not believe there is a gray area in ethical quality. There are the right things to do and the wrong things to do and we are only interested in doing the right things. Some other models that I liked were the full-disclosure model which means that you are acting ethically if your stakeholders would think that you are acting ethically. This is nice because it gives the stakeholders some say in the process. Another one that I found interesting is the golden rule model which is basically saying don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you. I find this interesting because I believe that in business, a lot of people act purely on their own best interests and understand when others also act on their own self interests which I am not a fan of because I believe that the average ethics might not be in the best interest of everybody. Which is why my company is focusing on the categorical imperative model.</p>
    <h1>10.  What is the engineering manager’s role in quality ethics? How does your company interpret the term: 'TQM'?</h1>
    <p>An engineering manager’s role in quality ethics is to ensure that the company is applying the quality of ethics that it intends to. As an engineering manager, you can not let your own beliefs get in the way of the company’s beliefs and you must inspire those around you to do the same. There may be tough times in a company’s lifespan where people will think of how to get ahead, perhaps unethically. It is important for engineering managers to make sure that everything in their control is being done ethically and that the quality is not changing in an unethical way. My company interprets the term Total Quality Management as what will push us past our competitors. By having all employees motivated to produce high quality work, this will ensure that our end product is high quality and better than competitors. </p>
